Final Capstone Project 1 :AnomaData (Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance)
This Capstone project is aimed at predicting the machine breakdown by identifying the anomalies in the data & perform maintenance before the equipment degrades or breaks down.
The evaluation was performed from the data containing columns as predictors and a seperate column ‘y’ having binary labels with 1 denoting there is an anomaly.
